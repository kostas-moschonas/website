Hi! I am Kostas Moschonas, Cardiology trainee, and PhD candidate at [St Barts Hospital](https://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/st-bartholomews) and [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cardiovascular/research/clinical-science/centre-cardiovascular-disease-imaging).

Currently I research blood flow abnormalities in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.

I am Greek-Italian but currently live in London with my wife. I love to dance, play guitar, read, write, hike in the mountains, and watch K-dramas!
