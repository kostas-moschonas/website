Hi! I am Kostas Moschonas, Cardiologist and Medical Researcher.

Currently, I am completing my PhD at [St Barts Hospital](https://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/st-bartholomews) and [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cardiovascular/research/clinical-science/centre-cardiovascular-disease-imaging). My research uses Echocardiography and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR), alongisde data science and machine learning techniques to explore the importance of blood flow abnormalities in Cardiovascular Disease, specifically Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, a genetic heart muscle condition.

I am Greek-Italian but currently live in London with my wife. I love to dance Greek Folk and Argentinian tango, play guitar, read, write, and hike in nature.

I grew up in Samos, a remote Greek island, where access to healthcare is limited and patients often travel to Athens for specialists consultations, diagnostic tests, and treatments. I want to use the enormous potential of recent medical advancements and MedTech to expand healthcare in rural and remote areas.

Also, I feel very strongly about public understanding of and trust in Medicine. Traditionally, doctors have been distant with little interest to explain what we do, how we think and why. I believe this has contributed to the recent rise in scepticism towards our field. COVID-19 taught us so much! Important decisions rely on the public understanding of Medicine, the trust towards our profession and the doctor-patient relationship, from individual decision behind our clinic doors, to public-health initiatives.

I am very enthusiastic to connect with fellow researches, clinicians, MedTech professionals, and members of the public. I welcome discussions on potential research collaborations, freelance data science projects, and consulting opportunities where my medical and data science expertise can make a difference. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge through public talks and workshops and exploring entrepreneurial ideas that can accelerate the translation of MedTech innovations into clinical practice.
