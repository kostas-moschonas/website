Hi! I am Kostas Moschonas, Cardiologist and Medical Researcher.

Currently, I am completing my PhD at [St Barts Hospital](https://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/st-bartholomews) and [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cardiovascular/research/clinical-science/centre-cardiovascular-disease-imaging). My research uses heart ultrasound (Echocardiography) and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, alongisde data science and machine learning techniques to explore the importance of blood flow abnormalities in Cardiovascular Disease, specifically Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, a common genetic heart muscle condition.

I am Greek-Italian and currently live in London with my wife. I love to dance Greek Folk and Argentinian tango, play guitar, read, write, and hike in nature.

I grew up in Samos, a remote Greek island, where access to healthcare is limited and patients often travel to Athens by airplane or ship for specialists consultations, diagnostic tests, and treatment. This has deeply marked my ideology and approach to the patient.

Also, I feel very passionately about teaching and helping to promote the public understanding of and trust in Medicine.
