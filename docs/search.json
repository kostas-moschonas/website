    "text": "Hi! I am Kostas Moschonas, Cardiologist and Medical Researcher.\nCurrently, I am completing my PhD at St Barts Hospital and UCL. My research uses heart ultrasound (Echocardiogram) and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance, alongisde data science and machine learning techniques, to explore the importance of blood flow abnormalities in Cardiovascular Disease, specifically Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, a common genetic heart muscle condition. I am fully funded by a Clinical Research Training Fellowship from the British Heart Foundation.\nI am Greek-Italian and currently live in London with my wife. I love to dance Greek Folk and Argentinian tango, play guitar, read, write, and hike in nature.\nI grew up in Samos, a remote Greek island, where access to healthcare is limited and patients often travel to Athens by airplane or ship for specialists consultations, diagnostic tests, and treatment. This has deeply marked my ideology and approach to the patient.\nAlso, I feel very passionately about teaching and helping to promote the public understanding of and trust in Medicine.\nEmail me at k.moschonas [at] nhs [dot] net"

    "text": "A collection of resources to learn Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) for clinicians, prioritising open access material where available.\n\nPhysics\nThe best place to start learning MRI physics are the outstanding lecture series by Dr Michael Nel! Watch them all, watch them again, and make notes! They are excellent foundations!\n\nAfterwards, I recommend these three open access reviews specifically for CMR, they are old but still very relevant:\n\nRidgway, John P. ‘Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Physics for Clinicians: Part I’. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 12, no. 1 (30 November 2010): 71. https://doi.org/10.1186/1532-429X-12-71.\nBiglands, John D., Aleksandra Radjenovic, and John P. Ridgway. ‘Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Physics for Clinicians: Part II’. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 14, no. 1 (20 September 2012): 66. https://doi.org/10.1186/1532-429X-14-66.\nFerreira, Pedro F, Peter D Gatehouse, Raad H Mohiaddin, and David N Firmin. ‘Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Artefacts’. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 15, no. 1 (January 2013): 41. https://doi.org/10.1186/1532-429X-15-41.\n\nAt this point, you are ready to dive into some more advanced literature on physics and techniques. (The) Dr Peter Kellman has a curated website with his publications and narrated presentations, all freely available. It is an incredibly valuable and altruistic initiative.\nQuestions and Answers in MRI is a renowned website by Dr Allen Elster, where you can find small articles about pretty much anything MRI. It is a good companion if you have questions.\nThe Society of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance offers a number of introductory webinars at the cost of subscription, including a in Physics.\n\n\nTextbooks\nThere are no open access textbooks to date, but you can find many of them in z-library and library genesis. This is a small collection.\nThe EACVI Textbook of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance is the official text by the EACVI. Some chapters are very well written, e.g. myocardial iron overload, but others are hit and miss. Usually, if you are preparing for the EACVI certification, you may not be able to avoid reading this book.\nThe Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, a Braunwald Companion is a larger, reference textbook, written in a very academic style. Despite its size, some common CMR topics are missing (e.g. hypertrabeculations, endomyocardial fibrsosis and many secondary cardiomyopathies) and some topics are perhaps given disproportionate emphasis (e.g. coronary and bypass grafting imaging, atherosclerotic plaque imaging).\nYou can access this and many other textbooks by Elsevier via ClinicalKey with an OpenAthens account. If you have an NHS email account, click here to register. Check if your academic affiliation also has access to ClinicalKey.\nYou may have access to the Cardiovascular MR Manual, 2015, from your institution. It is good but now nearly 10 years old.\nThe EACVI CMR pocket guides are good for a quick reference.\n\n\nJournal articles\nProvided how rapidly the field of CMR evolves, you will find yourself reaching out for original research articles or good peer reviews even in the beginning of your journey. For me, this was frustrating at first, as I wanted one or two good books to tell me what to do, but that didn’t happen. I advise you to search the literature for every topic you read and develop a disciplined note-keeping habit, even if you just write down a list of articles you found useful. I personally use OneNote, it is so quick to write there. For the power of habits, Ryan Holiday can explain!\nDefinitely use the open source reference management tool Zotero! It is not just for academics! Do not just keep your pdf articles in folders in your computer! This, combined with your disciplined notes, will become a powerful learning resource.\nI am in the process of curating a Group Library of landmark articles I find in my journey. Watch this space for more. And, hey!, if you have one or want to kickstart one instead, let me know, that’s what Open Libraries are for!\n\n\nAdult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD)\nDr Marina Hughes is responsible for most of the ACHD teaching at Barts, aimed at general CMR practitioners, not ACHD specialists. She recommends starting with the EACVI pocket guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareful of the typo\n\n\n\nOn page 33, Qp:Qs shunt calculation for PDA should be AoValve flow / Pulm valve flow, as with any post-tricuspid shunt.\n\n\nFor the clinical cardiology background of ACHD, the chapters in Braunwald Heart Disease are useful and concise, but you probably have your own resource already.\n\n\nMiscellanea\nThe collection of Guidelines and Positions Statements by the SCMR is useful. The EACVI also has a collection with recommended journal articles, but it has not been updated for a long time. Finally, the “How I Do” series by the SCMR is very good indeed, but unfortunately it is behind a subscription cost.\nIf you are interested in obtaining official certification, here is more information. Regardless, you can also use the syllabus for certification as an initial guide to your self-directed learning!\n\n\nSummary\nI hope this provides a good starting point to your new journey! Do not be discouraged with the absence of open-access textbooks. You can find many of them in z-library and library genesis. Nevertheless, they may not be as crucial to your learning as you anticipate. If you use the EACVI syllabus and pocket books to guide your study plan, you will find journal articles for essentially all the required topics! Do keep notes and use Zotero! Good luck!"

    "text": "“Science is unreasonably effective. It’s generated knowledge beyond all expectation. It’s also delivered perspective. Yes, we are an insignificant aspect of an infinite universe, but we are also rare. And because we’re rare, we’re valuable.\nSo what are we to do to secure our future? Well, we must learn to value the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake and not just because it grows our economy or allows us to build better bombs.\nWe must also learn to value the human race and take responsibility for our own survival. Why? Because there is nobody else out there to value us or to look after us.\nAnd finally, most important of all, we must educate the next generation in the great discoveries of Science. And we must teach to use the light of reason to banish the darkness of superstition. Because it we do that, then, at least, there’s a chance that this universe will remain a human one.”\nProf Brian Cox\nEpilogue of Episode 5, What is our Future?\nThe Human Universe, BBC"
