*"Science is unreasonably effective. It's generated knowledge beyond all expectation. It's also delivered perspective. Yes, we are an insignificant aspect of an infinite universe, but we are also rare. And because we're rare, we're valuable.*

*So what are we to do to secure our future? Well, we must learn to value the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake and not just because it grows our economy or allows us to build better bombs.*

*We must also learn to value the human race and take responsibility for our own survival. Why? Because there is nobody else out there to value us or to look after us.*

*And finally, most important of all, we must educate the next generation in the great discoveries of Science. And we must teach to use the light of reason to banish the darkness of superstition. Because it we do that, then, at least, there's a chance that this universe will remain a human one."*

Prof Brian Cox
